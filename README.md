# EliteAsians Unity Extensions
This is a pack of scripts that I made that adds utility methods to existing Unity classes such as `Vector2` and `Vector3`. So far, this repository is quite small, but I will be adding different extensions over time.

# Extensions
- [VectorExtensions](https://github.com/EliteAsian123/EliteAsians-Unity-Extensions/blob/master/VectorExtensions.md) (Contains extension methods for `Vector2` and `Vector3`)

# How to Install
To install these to your Unity project, simply clone this repository and plop the extension you like (any `.cs` file) into your project. That's it!

# License
This project uses a [MIT License](https://github.com/EliteAsian123/EliteAsians-Unity-Extensions/blob/master/LICENSE). Basically, you can use this in your game without permission, and you can modify as much as you want.

# Feature Requests and Issues
If you find an issue, or want to request a feature, create an issue in the [issues tab(https://github.com/EliteAsian123/EliteAsians-Unity-Extensions/issues).
